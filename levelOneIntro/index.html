			<h1>Welcome!</h1>
			<p>
				You are a sea turtle attempting to navigate the ocean to
				migrate, but you'll have to avoid vast amounts of plastic to get
				to where you're going.
			</p>
			<h2>The problem:</h2>
			<p>
				Currently, garbage gets imported from around the world into
				developing countries in East Asia, who are unable to handle the
				trash and end up dumping it into the ocean. This has created
				garbage patches such as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, shown
				below:

			<p>
				As a sea turtle migrating across the Pacific, you'll have to try
				to avoid all of this trash (use the left and right arrow keys or
				the A and D keys to move the turtle left and right and avoid the
				trash). Good luck!
