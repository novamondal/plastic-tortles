		<h1>Stage 2 of Ocean Pollution Reduction: Plastic Alternatives</h1>
		<p>
			Putting into place government incentive programs to fuel research
			into biodegradable plastics or plastic alternatives is an important
			step of our plan to get rid of ocean plastic, and hopefully plastic
			in general. Currently, some bioplastics are not even completely
			biodegradable and have the same issues of pollution and creation of
			microplastics as regular plastics, and also cost much more to
			produce and some kinds require special facilities to make them.
			Government incentives to reduce the costs of this process and make
			all bioplastics biodegradable. Also looking into complete
			alternatives such as paper bags etc. is an important part of
			eliminating plastic in our oceans.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			To encourage the development of more sustainable alternatives to
			plastics, the US government should create incentive programs and
			scientific research grants for companies developing disposable
			plastic alternatives that are truly biodegradable. These alternative
			materials currently include biodegradable resin straws and bamboo
			utensils, for example, but new materials would also be developed.
			This will help incentivize innovation and should bring down the end
			cost to consumers, since the R&D costs will be subsidized by the
			government. Lower end cost of plastic alternatives should encourage
			higher adoption, leading to less usage of disposable single-use
			plastics. It also opens the door to other legislative options in the
			future.

		<h2>Viability: Relatively Viable</h2>
		<p>
			The plan should be popular with the public, as it helps create new
			industries and the subsidies would help create jobs in the renewable
			materials industry. Funding for the incentive programs could be a
			roadblock, but this funding could easily come out reducing current
			subsidies of other, less beneficial industries such as industrial
			corn farming or oil subsidies.
