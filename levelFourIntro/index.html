		<h1>Stage 3 of Ocean Pollution Reduction: Plastic Bans</h1>
		<p>
			One of the biggest ways to prevent plastic from getting into the
			ocean in the first place is a national total ban on single use
			plastics. Places in America that have been able to pass legislation
			to ban single use plastics have seen drastic changes in their local
			ecosystems and environments in even short amounts of time, pairing
			this with cleanup efforts and a more efficient and non profit driven
			national recycling program and we have a way to effectively prevent
			most plastic from getting into the ocean in the first place. A 2022
			poll showed that 81% of American voters are in favor of legislation
			banning or reducing single use plastic use, so why haven’t we done
			this? One of the biggest things standing in the way of this progress
			is the immense power held by the oil and plastic lobby, who spend
			more than $85 million yearly to reduce restrictions on plastic
			production and recycling. This key part of the solution to the
			oceanic plastic crisis is to reduce or completely eliminate the
			power held by lobbyists in government, especially those in the oil
			and plastics industries who will spend whatever is necessary to
			ensure their bottom lines aren’t harmed by planet saving measures.

		<h2>Viability: Difficult, but Doable</h2>
		<p>
			As mentioned, petrochemical lobbyists will pose significant
			opposition to single-use plastic bans. However, with enough public
			support, it would still be possible to pass. The creation of better
			alternative materials through the previous stage's government
			incentive programs will help, as people will be familiar with
			alternatives to plastic and will be more likely to feel that
			plastics are unecessary.
