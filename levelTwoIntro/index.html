		<h2>Problems:</h2>
		<h3>Inability to recycle most plastics</h3>
		<p>
			Our current recycling systems mix together plastics, making it
			difficult to sort out and create usable recycled plastic products
		</p>
		<h3>Economically Impractical</h3>
		<p>
			Recycled plastic is generally more expensive and lower quality than
			new plastic, creating little incentive for companies to use recycled
			plastic and encouraging them to manufacture new plastic,
			contributing to pollution
		</p>
		<h3>Outsourcing</h3>
		<p>
			The biggest problem with our recycling programs is that the majority
			of our trash gets sold to other countries, where we have no control
			of the disposal of the waste. Most of these countries are poor or
			developing, and do not have the resources to properly process our
			plastic waste, leading them to improperly dispose of it. The net
			result is that the plastic ends up in the ocean
		</p>
		<h2>Solutions:</h2>
		<h3>Nationalized Recycling Program and No Outsourcing of Recycling</h3>
		<p>
			By nationalizing our recycling program and keeping all of our
			recycled plastics domestic, we can ensure that all of our waste is
			properly processed and recycled. This will also create jobs in the
			recycling industry, and reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in
			the ocean. By nationalizing the industry, the government can also
			limit the economic obstructions to recycling.
		</p>
		<h3>Limiting Scope of Recycling Programs</h3>
		<p>
			Currently, our recycling programs generally collect plastic that
			cannot even be practically recycled. This creates a false public
			impression that plastic waste is less of an issue because it can be
			recycled, when in reality the majority gets landfilled. By making it
			clear that only certain types of plastic can be recycled, the public
			is more aware of where their trash actually ends up, leading to
			better public habits regarding plastic usage.
		</p>
		<p>
			Limiting the scope of recycling programs to only a few types of
			plastic also makes it easier to sort through different types of
			plastic at recycling facilities, improving the efficiency of the
			recycling process.
		</p>
		<h2>Scope:</h2>
		<p>
			This would primarily involve the US, which produces the most plastic
			waste per capita. However, similar reforms could be put in place in
			any major developed country which produces a large amount of plastic
			waste.
		</p>
		<h2>Viability: Relatively High</h2>
		<p>
			There are no technological challenges to this stage of the plan, as
			the US already has the resources it needs to recycle its own plastic
			without exporting it (the primary reason recycled plastic currently
			gets exported is due to economic causes). The only barriers would be
			political, as the plastics and recycling industries would likely
			lobby against this kind of legislation. However, with enough public
			awareness and education, it should be relatively doable to pass
			recycling reform legislation.
